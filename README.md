### 🧠 About Me  
I'm an engineer and data scientist passionate about **AI applications, language models, and intelligent automation**.  
I combine a strong technical foundation in mechatronics with hands-on experience in **machine learning**, **data engineering**, and **AI system design**.  

At Deviniti, I focus on **building and integrating AI-driven solutions** for enterprise clients, both in cloud and on-prem environments.  
As part of the **SpeakLeash Foundation** and **Bielik.AI**, I contribute to the development of an **open Polish family of language models**, supporting national and community-based AI initiatives.

💡 I’m especially interested in:
- Building **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems and domain-specific LLM pipelines  
- Developing and optimizing **AI microservices** for NLP and multimodal analysis  
- Supporting **open-source AI ecosystems** and Polish-language research projects  
- Deepening my understanding of the **algorithms and architectures** behind current **state-of-the-art AI models**

### 🧩 Current Roles
- **Data Scientist @ Deviniti** – Developing AI solutions for enterprise workflows  
- **AI Engineer @ SpeakLeash Foundation** – Working on open Polish LLMs and datasets  
- **AI Engineer @ Bielik.AI** – Designing and deploying scalable NLP systems

### 🏗️ Past Experience
Before moving fully into AI, I spent several years at **Endress+Hauser**, where I managed projects in industrial automation, e-business, and sales engineering — connecting technology with practical business outcomes.  

This background helps me approach AI not just as research, but as a **bridge between innovation and real-world impact**.

### 🎤 Public Speaking
I’m an active speaker in the Polish AI community and often talk about:
- The **evolution of Polish language models** (e.g., Bielik)  
- **AI for everyday use** — practical applications for everyone  
- **Open innovation** and local AI ecosystems  
- **Enterprise AI systems** and their real-world use cases

Hi there, I’m @pawelkiszczak an I'm new to GitHub. 

I’m really interested into getting to program my own stuff and possible landing a job in the industry.

Currently I'm learning some stuff releated to Data Science and Machine Learning. I'm astonished how some simple code can let you perform prediction based
on the data you've provided earlier. I find this very powerful and almost limitless tool when used properly and I want to implement those in some of 
the projects I have in my head. Hoping I'll be able to post them here soon!

On my profile you'll be able to find Kaggle competition attempts, Leetcode submissions and notebooks describing my journey as a self-taught wannabe
data scientist/machine learning specialist/software engineer.

All the code I'm posting is either written by myself or coded along while taking courses.

Cheers!
